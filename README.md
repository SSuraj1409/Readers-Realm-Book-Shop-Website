<h1 align="center">📚 Readers Realm – Book Shop Website</h1>

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**Readers' Realm** is a simple and elegant online book shop website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **XML**, **XSL**, and **DTD**. The site demonstrates how structured XML data can be transformed and styled for web presentation using XSLT and CSS, without any JavaScript or server-side code. It serves as a static, educational project focused on data structuring, transformation, and presentation.

The website displays a catalog of books categorized by genre. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, price, description, and availability status. Using **XSL**, the raw XML book data is rendered into a user-friendly format for browsing.
