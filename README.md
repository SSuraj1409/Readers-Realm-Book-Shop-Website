## üìñ Project Overview

**Readers' Realm** is a simple and elegant online book shop website built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **XML**, **XSL**, and **DTD**. The site demonstrates how structured XML data can be transformed and styled for web presentation using XSLT and CSS, without any JavaScript or server-side code. It serves as a static, educational project focused on data structuring, transformation, and presentation.

The website displays a catalog of books categorized by genre. Each book entry includes details such as title, author, price, description, and availability status. Using **XSL**, the raw XML book data is rendered into a user-friendly format for browsing.

<h3>XML, XSL, and DTD Files:</h3>  
This project includes:

- A corresponding **DTD** file to validate XML structure  
- An **XSL** file that transforms XML into HTML for display  
These files work together to simulate a lightweight, data-driven static website.
